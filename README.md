# Building an Airbnb Price Prediction App with Streamlit

The project involved cleaning and preparing data from Airbnb listings in a Melbourne. This included tasks such as handling missing values, converting data into a suitable format for analysis, and removing outliers.Once the data was cleaned and prepared, it was used to train a machine learning model to predict the prices of Airbnb units. To train the model, various machine learning algorithms were tested and their performance was compared. After identifying the best performing algorithm, it was fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques. Once the model was trained, it was used to make predictions on a hold-out test set to evaluate its accuracy.

In addition to the machine learning aspect of the project, a streamlit app was also created. The app allows users to input their own listing information and receive a prediction of the price for their unit using the trained model. The app was deployed online, allowing users to easily access it from their web browser. Overall, the project demonstrated the importance of properly preparing data and selecting the right machine learning algorithm in order to build an accurate model for predicting Airbnb prices, as well as the utility of using a streamlit app to make the model easily accessible to users.
